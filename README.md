This is my first project I am offically posting on github in the CodeTalk bootcamp program. I had to try to replicate the news-article given to me with Html and little CSS. 

Through trial and error i managed to turn in the Minimum Viable product to complete the task with given instructions. 

Also, I learned that I still need to learn more about CSS in order to align text and items on my article.
